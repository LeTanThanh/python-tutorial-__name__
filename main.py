if __name__ == "__main__":
  # Whatâ€™s Python __name__?

  """
  If you have gone through Python code, you've likely seen the __name__ variable like the following:
  """

  if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("main()")

  """
  And you might wonder what the __name__ variable is.

  Since the __name__ variable has double underscores at both sides, it's called dunder name.
  The dunder stands for double undersores.

  The __name__ is a special veriable in Python.
  It's special because Python assigns a different value to it depending on how its containing script executes.

  When you import a module, Python executes the file associated with the module.

  Often, you want to write a script that can be executed directly or imported as a module.
  The __name__ variable allows you to do that.

  When you run the script directly, Python sets the __name__ variable to "__main__".

  However, if you import a file as a module, Python sets the module name to __name__ variable.

  # Python __name__ variable example

  """
  First, create a new module called billing that has two functions: calculate_tax() and print_billing_doc().
  In addtion, add a statement that prints out the __name__ variable to the screen:

  Second, create a new file called app.py and import the billing module:

  When you execute the app.py

  python app.py

  the __name__ variable shows the following value:

  billing

  It means that Python does execute the billing.py file when you import the billing module to the app.py file.
  The __name__ variable in the app.py set to the module name which is billing.

  If you execute the billing.py as a sscript directly:

  python billing.py

  you'll see the following output:

  __main__

  In this case the value of the __name__ variable is __main__ inside the billing.py.

  Therefore, the __name__ variables allows you to check when the file is executed directly or imported as a module.

  For example, to execute the print_billing_doc() function when the billing.py executes directly as a script, you can add teh following statement to the billing.py module:

  if __name__ == "__main__":
    print_billing_doc()

  Third, execute the billing.py as a script, you'll see the following output:

  However, when you execute the app.py, you won't see the if block executed because the __name__ variable doesn't set to the "__main__" but "billing"
